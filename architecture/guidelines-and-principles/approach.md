1. Supporting limited functionally and libraries for easier development (We will vote for the most common libraries and features)
   1. Instead of trying to support all the plugins and all the features, we will support only the most common ones.
   2. Limited libraries: a single library for each functionality (e.g., only one library for state management (Redux), one for icons).
   3. One framework: React / Next.js
   4. Single styling library: Tailwind CSS
   5. Single testing library: Jest
   6. Single CI/CD: GitHub Actions
   7. Single deployment: Vercel / AWS
   8. Single IDE: VS Code
   9. Single version control: Git
   10. Single package manager: yarn
   11. Single code formatter: Prettier
   12. Single linter: ESLint
2. Generating production ready maintainable code
3. Dogfooding - We will use the tool to build our own application
4. Using mostly external machine learning models and services, as they are developed rapidly and we need to focus on adopting them to our needs and productizing them.
5. Prefer Open Source solutions over proprietary ones
